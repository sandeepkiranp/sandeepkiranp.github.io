abstract: —This article deals with providing privacy-preserving
access control in Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Here, a
user/IoT device requests access to services provided by other
IoT devices and multiple requests are combined to a requestspecific service chain. An anonymous delegated credential-based
system architecture is proposed, where the requester’s identity
is not exposed to the services. The article presents the proposed
architecture’s various components including the security aspects.
Various options for implementing the architecture on resourcefull and resource-constrained services are presented. A prototype
of the proposed architecture is then implemented using Linuxbased containers to emulate the services. Two representative
systems, namely, a small-scale home automation system using
a short service chain and a large-scale industrial automation
system using a long service chain are considered. Timing measurements from the implementation are presented to demonstrate
that the architecture is feasible and can be adapted for practical
use in large-scale IoT systems.
