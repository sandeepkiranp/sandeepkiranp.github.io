abstract: Security and Privacy are some of the important aspects to be considered in the large-scale deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Due to the large number  of IoT devices and the different administrative domains in which they operate, traditional approaches involving a Centralized server for managing Authorizations will not be scalable or efficient. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Capability-Based Access Control framework using IOTA (DCACI); IOTA is an opensource distributed ledger that enables fee-less micro transactions for the IoT. The DCACI framework enables complete privacy and integrity of the Capability tokens using IOTAâ€™s Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) technology. It enables device owners and users to Grant, Update, Delegate and Revoke the capability tokens. The proposed DCACI framework has been implemented as a proof-of-concept on a resource constrained machine; the results indicate that it is capable of scaling up to large-scale infrastructure such as a Smart City, having  millions of IoT devices
