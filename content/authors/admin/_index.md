I am currently a PhD student  in the CS department at Stony Brook University, where I am a member of the Network Security and Applied Cryptography Lab advised by [Prof. Radu Sion](https://zxr.io/). I like building secure systems using cryptographic protocols to solve real-world problems. My current research involves building practical plausibly deniable systems that are truly private and censorship-resilient. I am also investigating the impact of ARM Trustzone on embedded applications.
